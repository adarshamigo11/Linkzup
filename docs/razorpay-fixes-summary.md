# Razorpay Payment Integration - Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. API Route Path Inconsistencies ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Different components were using different API paths:
- `payment-modal.tsx` used `/api/payments/`
- `PlansPopup.tsx` used `/api/payment/`

**Solution**: 
- Created missing API routes in `/api/payments/` directory
- Updated `PlansPopup.tsx` to use consistent `/api/payments/` paths
- All components now use the same API path structure

**Files Fixed**:
- `app/api/payments/create-order/route.ts` (new)
- `app/api/payments/verify/route.ts` (new)
- `app/api/payments/history/route.ts` (new)
- `app/api/payments/webhook/route.ts` (new)
- `components/PlansPopup.tsx` (updated API paths)

### 2. Plan Type Mismatches ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Different components used different plan type definitions:
- `lib/razorpay.ts` defined: `"starter" | "professional" | "enterprise"`
- `PlansPopup.tsx` used: `"basic" | "pro" | "enterprise"`

**Solution**:
- Standardized all plan types to use `"starter" | "professional" | "enterprise"`
- Updated `PlansPopup.tsx` to import plan definitions from `lib/razorpay.ts`
- Removed duplicate plan definitions

**Files Fixed**:
- `components/PlansPopup.tsx` (updated plan types and imports)

### 3. User Model Subscription Field Mismatch ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: API routes tried to update a `subscription` object, but User model had separate fields:
- API expected: `subscription: { plan, status, startDate, endDate, paymentId }`
- User model had: `subscriptionStatus`, `subscriptionPlan`, `subscriptionExpiry`

**Solution**:
- Updated all API routes to use the correct User model field names
- Fixed subscription update logic in verify and webhook routes

**Files Fixed**:
- `app/api/payment/verify/route.ts`
- `app/api/payment/webhook/route.ts`
- `app/api/payments/verify/route.ts` (new)
- `app/api/payments/webhook/route.ts` (new)

### 4. Missing Payment History API Route ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: `payment-history.tsx` component expected `/api/payments/history` but the route didn't exist

**Solution**:
- Created comprehensive payment history API route with pagination
- Added proper error handling and data formatting
- Included status mapping and failure reason handling

**Files Fixed**:
- `app/api/payments/history/route.ts` (new)

### 5. Inconsistent Plan Definitions ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Multiple files had different plan definitions with varying prices and features

**Solution**:
- Centralized all plan definitions in `lib/razorpay.ts`
- Ensured consistent pricing and features across all components
- Added proper TypeScript types for plan validation

**Files Fixed**:
- `lib/razorpay.ts` (centralized plan definitions)
- `components/PlansPopup.tsx` (removed duplicate definitions)

### 6. Missing Environment Variable Documentation ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: No clear documentation on required environment variables

**Solution**:
- Created comprehensive setup documentation
- Added troubleshooting guide
- Included testing instructions

**Files Fixed**:
- `docs/razorpay-setup.md` (new)

### 7. Missing Test Script ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: No way to verify the payment integration setup

**Solution**:
- Created comprehensive test script
- Added environment variable validation
- Included package installation checks
- Added signature verification tests

**Files Fixed**:
- `scripts/test-payment-integration.js` (new)
