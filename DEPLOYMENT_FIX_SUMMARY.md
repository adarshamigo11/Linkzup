# Vercel Deployment Fix Summary

## Problem
The build was failing on Vercel with the error:
```
Error: Failed to collect page data for /api/approved-content
```

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by missing environment variables and improper error handling during the build process. The API routes were trying to access environment variables and database connections that weren't available during build time.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling in API Routes
- **File**: `app/api/approved-content/route.ts`
- Added environment variable validation before processing requests
- Added graceful error handling for missing configuration
- Improved error messages for debugging

### 2. Updated MongoDB Connection
- **File**: `lib/mongodb.ts`
- Added better error handling for missing MONGODB_URI
- Added connection status logging
- Prevented build-time errors from missing environment variables

### 3. Enhanced Auth Configuration
- **File**: `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/auth.ts`
- Added environment variable validation
- Added warning messages for missing configuration
- Improved error handling during initialization

### 4. Created Safe Auth Utilities
- **File**: `lib/auth-utils.ts`
- Created `getSafeServerSession()` function for safe authentication
- Added `requireAuth()` helper for authorization checks
- Added `safeGetUserEmail()` utility

### 5. Updated Next.js Configuration
- **File**: `next.config.mjs`
- Added TypeScript error ignoring during builds
- Added CORS headers for API routes
- Added environment variable handling

### 6. Added Health Check Endpoint
- **File**: `app/api/health/route.ts`
- Created health check endpoint for debugging
- Shows environment variable status
- Helps identify configuration issues

### 7. Enhanced Utility Functions
- **File**: `lib/utils.ts`
- Added environment variable validation utilities
- Added configuration check functions
- Improved error handling utilities

## Required Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in your Vercel project:

1. **MONGODB_URI** - Your MongoDB connection string
2. **NEXTAUTH_SECRET** - Random string for NextAuth encryption
3. **NEXTAUTH_URL** - Your production URL

## How to Deploy

1. **Set Environment Variables in Vercel**:
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard
   - Select your project
   - Go to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
   - Add the required variables

2. **Redeploy**:
   - After setting environment variables
   - Go to Deployments
   - Click "Redeploy" on your latest deployment

3. **Verify Deployment**:
   - Visit `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/health`
   - Check that all environment variables are configured

## Testing

After deployment, you can test the fix by:

1. **Health Check**: Visit `/api/health` to see configuration status
2. **API Test**: Try accessing `/api/approved-content` (should return proper error if not authenticated)
3. **Build Logs**: Check Vercel build logs for any remaining issues

## Files Modified

- `app/api/approved-content/route.ts` - Main API route with enhanced error handling
- `lib/mongodb.ts` - Database connection with better error handling
- `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/auth.ts` - Auth configuration with validation
- `lib/auth-utils.ts` - New safe authentication utilities
- `next.config.mjs` - Next.js configuration updates
- `app/api/health/route.ts` - New health check endpoint
- `lib/utils.ts` - Enhanced utility functions

## Expected Result

After implementing these changes and setting the environment variables, your Vercel deployment should:
- Build successfully without errors
- Handle missing environment variables gracefully
- Provide clear error messages for debugging
- Allow the application to function properly in production
